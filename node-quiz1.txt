6) Please create a basic outline for a CRUD application for the following:
I am your client, and I need an API for a stock market app I am building. Happily, you got the
job!!
I need the following data:
- stock name
- stock symbol
- stock price
- time.date of price
- market instrument is traded on
I will need the the full complement of CRUD for my API. Read should include the ability to
retrieve all the stocks, or one stock.
Create an outline or plan for the data, and the end points. No need to write the code, but I do
want to see the plan that you would implement the API from. Use the following as a model:
{
 "stockName": "gold",
 "i d": 1,
 "stockSymbol": g,
 "stockPrice": 135.00,
 "timeDateofPrice": 14:00,
 "marketInstrument":"huhuuh"
}
{
 " GET /stockMarkets": {
 "desc": "returns all stockMarket",
 "response": "200 application/json",
 "dat a": [{}, {}, {}]
 },

 " GET /stockMarkets/:i d": {
"desc": "returns one stockMarket respresented by its i d",
"response": "200 application/json",
"dat a": {}
},
" POST /stockMarkets": {
"desc": "create and returns a new stockMarket uisng the posted object as the stockMarket",
"response": "201 application/json",
"dat a": {}
},
" PUT /stockMarkets/:i d": {
"desc": "updates and returns the matching stockMarket with the post edupdate
object",
"response": "200 application/json",
"dat a": {}
},
" DELETE /stockMarkets/:i d": {
"desc": "deletes and returns the matching stockMarket",
"response": "200 application/json",
"dat a": {}
}
}


7) What is the “event Loop”?
-The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions.
JavaScript  doesn't start processing the event loop until the
code after an async function has executed,

8) What is a callback?
-is a function that is passed to another function.


9) Please explain synchronous vs asynchronous behavior.
-When you execute something synchronously, you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task.
When you execute something asynchronously,
you can move on to another task before it finishes.

10) What is package.json?
-This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project
and handle the projects dependencies.

11) Which module is used for file based operations?

-fs module.
var fs = require("fs");

12) How will you open a file using node?
  -we can use the fs.readFile

-The directory name of the current module  that the currently executing script resides in.

  14) Can you access the DOM in node?
  -yes.

  15) Explain briefly how node.js solves the problem of blocking i/o.
  -I/O is shorthand for Input and Output and it means accessing anything outside of your application.

Blocking refers to operations that block further execution until that operation finishes.
 Non-blocking refers to code that doesn't block execution.

  16) What is the most common used framework used in node.js? Hint: It’s used to write web
  servers.
